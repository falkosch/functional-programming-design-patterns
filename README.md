# functional-programming-design-patterns

This project demonstrates popular software design patterns of Object-Oriented programming adopted for functional programming. It doesn't re-implement OOP patterns in a weird FP like way. I rather want encourage you to think in a functional way instead of trying to solve occurring problems in the FP world with OOP.

## Demonstrated Patterns

You will find runnable examples in `lib/<name of pattern>/*` for each demonstrated software design pattern:

* [Strategy Pattern](./src/strategy/)
* [Facade Pattern](./src/facade/)
* [(more to come...)](./src/)
