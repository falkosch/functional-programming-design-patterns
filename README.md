# functional-programming-design-patterns

This project demonstrates how you can adopt popular software design patterns of Object-Oriented Programming for Functional Programming.

The examples are open for discussion and shall only give an insight of how you can design your functions in a practical way.

## Demonstrated Patterns

You will find runnable examples in `lib/<name of pattern>/*` for each demonstrated software design pattern:

* [Strategy Pattern](./src/strategy/)
* [Facade Pattern](./src/facade/)
* [(more to come...)](./src/)

After `npm install`, run `npm start` to see the output of the examples.
